    Note over Pytest, Client: Setup Phase (Class Scope)

    Pytest->>Base: Discover autouse fixture: setup_api_client
    Base->>Pytest: Request dependency: generate_api_client
    Pytest->>Conftest: Call fixture: generate_api_client
    Conftest->>Client: Instantiate APIClient()
    Client-->>Conftest: Return client instance
    Conftest-->>Base: Inject client instance
    Base->>Base: self.api_client = client
    Note right of Base: TestAPI instance now has self.api_client

    Note over Pytest, Client: Execution Phase (Function Scope)

    Pytest->>Test: Execute test_get_request_success()
    Test->>Base: Call self.request_by_get_and_success(url)
    
    Base->>Client: self.api_client.get(url)
    Client-->>Base: Return Response
    Base->>Base: assert status_code == 200
    Base-->>Test: Return Response

    Test->>Pytest: Test Finished (Pass)
